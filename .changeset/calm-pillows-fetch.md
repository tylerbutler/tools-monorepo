Add 'version' and 'which' command

The `version` command can be used to get detailed version information about the command. This command is implemented by
[@oclif/plugin-version](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-version).

The `which` command can be used to find which plugin a command is in. This command is implemented by
[@oclif/plugin-which](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-which).
