New repopo policy

sort-tsconfig now provides a policy that can be used with [repopo](https://github.com/tylerbutler/tools-monorepo/tree/main/packages/repopo#repopo---police-the-files-in-your-git-repo-with-extensible-policies). This policy can be used to keep all tsconfig files
in your repo sorted.
