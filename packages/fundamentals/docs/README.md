# @tylerbu/fundamentals

This package contains fundamental, zero-dependency functions and classes that I often need in my projects. 

See [the API summary](https://github.com/tylerbutler/tools-monorepo/blob/main/packages/fundamentals/docs/cli-api.api.md) for
an overview of the API. Public APIs should all be documented, but the docs aren't yet published anywhere.
