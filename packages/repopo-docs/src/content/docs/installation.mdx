## Installation

You can install repopo into your project using your favorite package manager.

### For use as a CI/CD/dev tool

If you're using repopo for CI/CD purposes, then you probably want to install repopo as a dev dependency only.

<PackageManagers pkg="repopo" dev="true" />

### For use in your own program

TODO

<PackageManagers pkg="repopo" />

### Or install it globally

You can also install repopo globally if you prefer.
