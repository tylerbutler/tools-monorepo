Defined in: [policy.ts:90](https://github.com/tylerbutler/tools-monorepo/blob/main/packages/repopo/src/policy.ts#L90)

A RepoPolicy checks and applies policies to files in the repository.

Each policy has a name and a match regex for matching which files it should apply to. Every file in th repo is
enumerated and if it matches the regex for a policy, that policy is applied.

Each policy includes a handler function that checks a file against the policy and can optionally resolve any problems
(automated resolutions depend on the policy implementation).
