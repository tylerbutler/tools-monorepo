> `const` **NoJsFileExtensions**: [`RepoPolicy`](../interfaces/RepoPolicy.html)

Defined in: [policies/NoJsFileExtensions.ts:12](https://github.com/tylerbutler/tools-monorepo/blob/main/packages/repopo/src/policies/NoJsFileExtensions.ts#L12)

A repo policy that checks for JavaScript source files that just use the .js file extension. Such files may be
interpreted by node as either CommonJS or ESM based on the `type` field in the nearest package.json file. This
can create unexpected behavior for JS files; changing the package.json nearest to one will change how the JS
is processed by node. Using explicit file extensions reduces ambiguity and ensures a CJS file isn't suddenly treated
like an ESM file.
