## Automated Quality Checks

### Format Validation

```bash
# Check markdown formatting
npx markdownlint-cli2 "src/content/docs/**/*.md"

# Validate internal links
npx markdown-link-check src/content/docs/**/*.md

# Check code blocks are valid
# (CCL syntax validation if available)
```

### Readability Metrics

```bash
# Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
# Target: 10-12 (technical audience)
npx readability-cli src/content/docs/**/*.md

# Word count per document
wc -w src/content/docs/**/*.md
```

### Content Validation

```bash
# Verify no broken citations
grep -r "CITATION NEEDED" src/content/docs/

# Check for consistency
# (terminology, naming conventions)
```

## Success Criteria Summary

### Quantitative (Measurable)

- ‚úÖ **Total reduction**: 2,185 ‚Üí 450-560 lines (74%)
- ‚úÖ **POC documentation**: All 3 files within target ranges
- ‚è≥ **Readability**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12
- ‚è≥ **User comprehension**: ‚â•80% understand syntax in ‚â§5 minutes
- ‚è≥ **Implementer success**: ‚â•80% working parser in ‚â§1 hour

### Qualitative (Validated)

- ‚úÖ **Blog alignment**: All major claims have blog post citations
- ‚úÖ **No magic**: Core concepts clearly explained
- ‚úÖ **Core preservation**: Recursive parsing and fixed-point maintained
- ‚è≥ **Clear separation**: Core CCL vs library features distinguished
- ‚è≥ **Navigation**: Users/implementers have clear paths

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

**Recursive parsing and fixed-point content**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST preserve in parsing-algorithm.md
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Blog post confirms these are core CCL
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deletion would contradict format definition

**Mitigation**: Validation checkpoint before any reduction to parsing-algorithm.md

### Medium-Risk Areas

**Dotted keys (not in blog post)**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inference from "values are strings" principle
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some implementations support dotted key expansion

**Mitigation**: Keep minimal explanation, mark as optional implementation feature

### Monitoring

**During Phase 1-4 execution**:
- üîç Every deletion reviewed against traceability matrix
- üîç Core concept preservation verified at each phase boundary
- üîç Quality gates checked before phase transitions

## Conclusion

These quality gates provide:

1. **Measurable criteria** for success (quantitative metrics)
2. **Validation checkpoints** at each phase boundary
3. **Risk mitigation** for high-risk areas (core concept preservation)
4. **Automated checks** where possible (format, links, readability)
5. **Empirical validation** framework (implementer success rate)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 after validation-results.md framework is complete.

**Critical**: All changes must pass quality gates before phase transitions. No exceptions for core concept preservation.
