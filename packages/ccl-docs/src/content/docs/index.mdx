## Why CCL?

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Simple human-readable syntax" icon="open-book">
		CCL is easy to read and write. The syntax is delightfully `"`, `{`, and `}` free! You can use indentation to
		organize hierarchical data, but you don't have to.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Comments and multiline values" icon="comment">
		Unlike JSON, CCL supports comments and multiline values. Configuration files should be human-friendly.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Composable and extensible" icon="puzzle">
		The CCL core focuses on string-only key-value pairs with a progressive API. Build custom features on this simple foundation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Mathematical foundation" icon="star">
		Based on Category Theory principles, CCL provides predictable composition and merging behavior.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```ccl
app =
  name = MyWebApp
  version = 1.0.0

server =
  host = 0.0.0.0
  port = 8080

allowed_origins =
  = https://example.com
  = https://www.example.com

/= Configuration comment
debug = true
```
