title: What is dill?
---

dill is a command-line (terminal) program intended to do one thing, and one thing only - to **download gzipped files and
optionally decompress their contents.** It also provides a simple programmatic API to do the same thing.

## Why?

dill is intended for use in CI/CD systems for TypeScript and JavaScript projects. It fills a similar need to `curl` or
`wget` -- a straightforward way to download a file given its URL -- but is intended for use with gzipped [tar
files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)), also known as tarballs. Decompressing these files in a
cross-platform way is quick and easy with dill.

In TypeScript/JavaScript projects, dependencies are typically specified using package.json, and thus it's most
convenient to use only things that can be specified and installed using package.json. Moreover, dill is written in
TypeScript and doesn't have any direct native dependencies. Thus, dill enables you to run the same build process locally
as in CI/CD.

## Implementation

Implementation-wise, dill is written in TypeScript and uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) via
[node-fetch-native](https://github.com/unjs/node-fetch-native) to download files, which means it is reasonably
cross-platform and will use native Fetch implementations where available.

The dill CLI is built using [oclif](). If you have an oclif-powered CLI app, you can [use dill as a command in your own CLI.](/guides/subcommand/).

## Inspiration

dill was inspired by the largely defunct [download-cli](https://github.com/kevva/download-cli) package. That package is
outdated and appears to be abandoned, but the need for it still exists. Enter dill.
