## Installation

You can install dill into your project using your favorite package manager.

### For use as a CI/CD/dev tool

If you're using dill for CI/CD purposes, then you probably want to install dill as a dev dependency only.

<PackageManagers pkg="dill-cli" dev="true" />

### For use in your own program

If you want to use [dill's API](/usage/api-usage) or [use it in your own oclif CLI](/usage/subcommand), then you
should install it as a production dependency.

<PackageManagers pkg="dill-cli" />

### Or install it globally

You can also install dill globally if you prefer.
